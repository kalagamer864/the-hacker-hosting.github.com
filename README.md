# The Hacker Hosting — Demo project

This is a demo full-stack starter project for "The Hacker Hosting".
It includes:
- Static frontend in `public/` (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Node + Express backend with simple JWT auth, bcrypt password hashing
- Socket.IO demo for console logs
- A small JSON file-based "database" (`db.json`) for local testing

## Quick start (local)
1. Install Node.js (18+).
2. Extract the zip and `cd` into the project folder.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

This project is a demonstration scaffold — **not production ready**. Replace the JWT secret and swap JSON file DB for a real database before any real deployment.
